# Reffect
Reffect is a [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon allowing customizable display of effects and resources.

This project is inspired by [WeakAuras](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2) from World of Warcraft and [GW2Clarity](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Clarity).
Requires the [Nexus](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/Nexus) addon manager ([website](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus)). We have channels for discussion and sharing packs on the [Raidcore (Nexus) Discord](https://discord.gg/raidcore).

**WARNING:** Reffect performs memory reading. Use the addon and created displays at your own risk. See [our information policy](#information-policy) below and the [Guild Wars 2 policy on third-party programs](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013625034-Policy-Third-Party-Programs).

## Installation
1. Install the [Nexus](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/Nexus) addon manager ([website](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus)).
2. Download [`reffect.dll`](../../releases/latest) and place it in your `addons` folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\addons`).
3. Open the Nexus addon window, click on the refresh button if necessary and load Reffect.
4. *Optional: read the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md), [documentation on elements](./docs/elements.md).*

## Information Policy
Reffect uses memory reading to access internal information of the Guild Wars 2 game client.
The information is retrieved with the following policy in mind:

1. The information must be currently conveyed to the player via the graphical user interface. If it is conveyed to the player anyway, we consider it fine to give the same pieces of information in an alternative format.

2. The alternative display format must limit combination of individual pieces of information to a reasonably low logical complexity. We do **not** consider it fine to combine individual pieces of information to new information that is much more than the sum of its parts.

## Limitations 
- Not available in competitive modes (PvP & WvW).
- Generic effects do not show durations above 5 seconds. *Ingame this information is usually only visible on hover. With 5s left effect icons start to blink, conveying the remaining duration to the player.*
- Screen border effects do not show durations.
- No true stack count for duration stacking effects.
- No information about effects hidden from the player.
- No combining logic for multiple triggers outside of grouping stacks of multiple effects into a single UI element.
- No information about profession resources when hidden from the player.
- No information about ability cooldowns when hidden from the player.
