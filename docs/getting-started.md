# Getting started
Reffect does not come with any predefined display setups included.
Instead users can create and share their own configurations.

## Installing existing packs
Shared packs come as `.json` files.
In order to install one, open the editor ingame and click on the `Open folder` button.
Alternatively you can navigate to `Guild Wars 2\addons\reffect\packs` manually.
Simply drop the pack file into that folder and click `Reload packs` ingame.
Make sure to click `Save changes` first if you modified any elements in the meantime.
Also do not forget to copy any local icon files required by the pack to `Guild Wars 2\addons\reffect\icons`.

If you want to learn more about making your own adjustments the pack(s) you just installed, see the documentation on [elements](./elements.md).
